Description: Provides probability matrix of the most frequent treatment rankings
  by sampling the multivariate normal of the NMA effect sizes. One can also
  describe complex selection ranking criteria through a simple syntax and basic
  functions introduced and calculate their probability. Netmeta
  can be used for analysis or an existing league table can be provided.
