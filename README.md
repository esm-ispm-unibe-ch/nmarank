## nmarank reproducible branch

The repo contains scripts and data in the examples folder that reproduce the results
of the BMC MRM publication examples.

See the Woods.R and depression.R scripts
the depression data are in the data folder

The number of samples in the paper is vastly bigger than the default nsim=10000
we use in the scripts for convenience

To run the examples just type in R ```source("Woods.R")``` and
```source("depression.R")``` inside the examples folder
